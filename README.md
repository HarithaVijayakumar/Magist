Key learnings-

After deep data analyzation it is clear that _Magist_ is **not an ideal** company to team up with _Eniac_ because of poor delivery system and lack of tech sellers. Since Eniac is a 100% tech company Magist clearly indicates that non tech sellers earns a good profitable income than tech sellers, this also questions if revenue wise this would be a good deal. Due to poor delivery system Magist will disappoint Eniac's customers because good customer experience is our emblem.

Challenges overcame-
Personally I did not overcome any chanllenges as it was a team work. All my questions were immediately solved.

Additional reflections-
This is my first project. Initially it was all confusing but once the presentation was being prepared they all made sense.
