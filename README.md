# Magist
Is **Magist** a good partner for **Eniac**? Lets find out!

### **Languages and Librabies that are used**-

SQL
Tableau
Canvas

### **Key learnings**-

After deep data analyzation it is clear that _Magist_ is **not an ideal** company to team up with _Eniac_ because of poor delivery system and lack of tech sellers. Since Eniac is a 100% tech company Magist clearly indicates that non tech sellers earns a good profitable income than tech sellers, this also questions if revenue wise this would be a good deal. Due to poor delivery system Magist will disappoint Eniac's customers because good customer experience is our emblem.

### **Challenges overcame**-

Personally I did not overcome any chanllenges as it was a team work. All my questions were immediately solved.

### **Additional reflections**-

This is my first project. Initially it was all confusing but once the presentation was being prepared they all made sense.
